## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Common Issues

#### 🖼️ Images Not Loading
```bash
# Check permissions
adb shell pm list packages | grep framey

# Check MediaStore access
adb logcat | grep Framey

# Restart media scanner
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MEDIA_MOUNTED -d file:///sdcard
```

#### 🔨 Build Issues
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Update dependencies
flutter pub upgrade

# Check Flutter doctor
flutter doctor -v

# Rebuild
flutter run
```

#### 📱 Layout Overflow Errors
```
A RenderFlex overflowed by X pixels
```
- **Cause**: Album card content too tall for fixed height container
- **Solution**: Ensure padding and text sizing are properly constrained
- **Prevention**: Use Flexible widgets for text content in fixed-height containers

#### 📁 Media Item Not Found Errors
```
Error loading media: Exception: Media item not found
```
- **Cause**: Media viewer only searched first 100 items, missing items beyond that
- **Solution**: App now searches through entire media library with pagination
- **Prevention**: Media loading now handles large libraries properly

#### 🔍 Search Not Working
```
Search bar shows "coming soon" dialog
```
- **Solution**: Search functionality has been fully implemented with real-time filtering
- **How to use**: Tap menu → Search → Type in the search bar to filter photos

#### 🔐 Permission Issues
- **Cause**: Android 12+ requires granular media permissions
- **Solution**: 
  - Android 13+: Grant READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
  - Android 10-12: Grant READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
  - Go to Settings → Apps → Framey → Permissions if needed

#### 📲 App Crashes on Startup
```bash
# Check device logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(FATAL|AndroidRuntime|Framey)"

# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.example.framey

# Reinstall
flutter run --release
```
